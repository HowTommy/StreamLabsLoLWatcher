# StreamLabsLoLWatcher

This app is used for people who stream League of Legends with StreamLabs OBS : it displays a very ugly popup to remember to switch scenes in StreamLabs OBS, so that you don't stream your client but the game.

You need to setup keyboard shortcuts for your scenes to use it.

For the process, you must pick "League of Legends" with the game launched. The others are RIOT anti-cheat or the client.

I hope that StreamLabs will someday implement the automatic switch of scenes.

Enjoy!
