# StreamLabsLoLWatcher

This app is used for League of Legends : it displays a very ugly popup to remember to switch scenes in StreamLabs OBS, so that you don't stream your client.

You need to setup keyboard shortcuts for your scenes to use it.

I hope that StreamLabs will someday implement the auto switch of OBS.

Enjoy!
